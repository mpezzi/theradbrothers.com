The world's #1 wheat beer comes to you from the heart of Bavaria. Erdinger Weissbier has a beautiful golden straw colour that owes its champagne-like effervescence to secondary fermentation in the keg. Traditional Bavarian Wheat Ale, brewed in strict
accordance with the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516.
